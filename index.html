			<p>	Got kind of tired packin' and unpackin' - town to town and up and down the dial. Now were up in the big leagues getting' our turn at bat. Didn't need no welfare states. Everybody pulled his weight. Gee our old Lasalle ran great. Those were the days. The weather started getting rough - the tiny ship was tossed. If not for the courage of the fearless crew the Minnow would be lost. the Minnow would be lost. </p>
			<p>	Fleeing from the Cylon tyranny the last Battlestar â€“ Galactica - leads a rag-tag fugitive fleet on a lonely quest - a shining planet known as Earth. These Happy Days are yours and mine Happy Days. The mate was a mighty sailin' man the Skipper brave and sure. Five passengers set sail that day for a three hour tour a three hour tour. Just two good ol' boys Never meanin' no harm. Beats all you've ever saw been in trouble with the law since the day they was born. Then one day he was shootin' at some food and up through the ground came a bubblin' crude. Oil that is. Sunday Monday Happy Days. Tuesday Wednesday Happy Days. Thursday Friday Happy Days.Saturday what a day. Groovin' all week with you. The first mate and his Skipper too will do their very best to make the others comfortable in their tropic island nest. The Love Boat soon will be making another run. The Love Boat promises something for everyone. I have always wanted to have a neighbor just like you. I've always wanted to live in a neighborhood with you. Michael Knight a young loner on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent. The helpless. The powerless in a world of criminals who operate above the law. Maybe you and me were never meant to be. But baby think of me once in awhile. I'm at WKRP in Cincinnati. As long as we live its you and me baby. There ain't nothin' wrong with that. And we know Flipper lives in a world full of wonder flying there-under under the sea."</p>
